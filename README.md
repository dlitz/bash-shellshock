bash-shellshock wrapper
=======================

This is a small wrapper around /bin/bash that refuses to start bash if any
environment variables start with '('.  It can also be run in a log-only mode
and a mode that strips these 'bad' environment variables.

You can install this as a temporary workaround if you don't fully trust the
latest patches for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, which (as of 2014-09-25)
seem like they've been a bit rushed.


Example session
---------------

```sh
$ ls -l /bin/bash*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      20 Sep 26 01:12 /bin/bash -> /bin/bash-shellshock
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1029624 Sep 24 11:51 /bin/bash.real
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   10368 Sep 26 00:32 /bin/bash-shellshock

$ XX=1 XXX='(hello' /bin/bash -c env
bash-shellshock: Refusing to start due to possibly unsafe environment variable (see syslog)

$ sudo touch /etc/bash-shellshock.strip-vars

$ XX=1 XXX='(hello' bash -c env | grep ^XX
XX=1

$ sudo touch /etc/bash-shellshock.log-only

$ XX=1 XXX='(hello' bash -c env | grep ^XX
XX=1
XXX=(hello

$ sudo grep 'bash-shellshock\[' /var/log/auth.log

$ rm -f /etc/bash-shellshock.log-only /etc/bash-shellshock.strip-vars
```


Downloading
-----------

- Binary .deb packages for Debian and Ubuntu:

    https://github.com/dlitz/bash-shellshock/tree/binaries/binaries

- Source code:

    https://github.com/dlitz/bash-shellshock


Building from source
--------------------

* To build and install this package from source under Debian or Ubuntu, clone
  the repository and run:

```sh
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -tc
sudo dpkg -i ../bash-shellshock_1.0_amd64.deb
```

  See also the [docs/sbuild.md](docs/sbuild.md) file for information about
  building using sbuild.

* To compile manually, run this:

```sh
make
make install
ln /bin/bash /bin/bash.real
ln -sf /bin/bash-shellshock /bin/bash
```

  You may need to adjust the paths in the Makefile.


Configuration
-------------

If bash-shellshock finds environment variables starting with '(', it will do
one of three things (in order of priority):

1. If `/etc/bash-shellshock.log-only` exists, it will log the event to syslog
   and exec `/bin/bash.real`.

2. If `/etc/bash-shellshock.strip-vars` exists, it will log the event to
   syslog, remove the variable from the environment, and exec `/bin/bash.real`.

3. Otherwise, it will log the event to syslog and abort with exit status 255.


Testing
-------

* For CVE-2014-6271

```sh
env X='() { ignored; }; /bin/echo "You are vulnerable to CVE 2014-6271"' bash -c true
```

* For CVE-2014-7169 ([reference](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/514887394294652929)):

```sh
env X='() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat echo
```


Logging
-------

Logs go to the `LOG_AUTHPRIV` syslog facility, which is typically found at `/var/log/auth.log`.


Caveat
------

This might break bash scripts that rely on receiving functions and/or arrays
via the environment.  You probably shouldn't do that anyway.


Better solution
---------------

Remove this silly feature from bash in the first place.
